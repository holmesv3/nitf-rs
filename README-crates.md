# nitf-rs

A minimal rust NITF file interface

For basic examples of reading and writing, see [the examples](https://github.com/holmesv3/nitf-rs/tree/main/examples)

If you have questions, would like to contribute, or would like something added, please open an issue.

### Note: 
Formerly, there was `Sicd` functionality built into this crate. That has been moved into a separate crate [sicd-rs](https://crates.io/crates/sicd-rs)
